Java control flow graph

This project uses ACM library to build a program`s control flow graph(directed graph) in tree represenation which then can be used to change the existing code according to the properties of the control flow graph. (remove unused methods, etc.)

To run the program:

Pass a string with directory of the jar file that we need to create the control graph for as the console argument in the format C:/User/Example/example.jar*/

The main class is called RSdeob.
